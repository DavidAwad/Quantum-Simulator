# Quantum-Simulator
Quantum Computing Simulation Software for experimentation with quantum logic gates.

I noticed there wasn't a lot of work happening in the field of simulating quantum computation on classical machines.
This project aims to simply simulate quantum gates so you might determine the usefulness of using a quantum computer or quantum algorithms.


## Requirements
- Python 2.7+



## Available Gates
It currently realizes a Ï€/8 gate, a controlled-not gate and the Hadamard gate. With more to come soon hopefully.




#### NOTE: this is a classical simulation of a quantum system and so n qubits requires 2 ^ n complex numbers with each operation affecting every one of those complex numbers.
