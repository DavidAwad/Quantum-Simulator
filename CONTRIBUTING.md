## For Physicists
For the sake of clarity, I'm not a quantum physicist.
I'm only learning about quantum computing in my free time and writing simulators for my own benefit.


## For Programmers
As always, if there are bugs, PRs are welcome, feel free to create issues or
complain about things and I'll do my best to help out. Thanks!
