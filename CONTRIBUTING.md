## For Physicists
For the sake of clarity, I'm not a quantum physicist.
I'm only learning about quantum computing in my free time and writing simulators for my own benefit. I suspect those errors are subtle and might exist for the more complex 2 qubit operations.

If there are any problems with the science or how the system should be represented please feel free to contact me or make an issue.


## For Programmers
As always, if there are bugs, PRs are welcome, feel free to create issues or complain about things and I'll do my best to help out.

For Pull Requests I do ask that the code follows PEP 8 style guidelines as that's pretty important to me. It has to pass test cases as well of course.


Thank you for being interested in contributing!
